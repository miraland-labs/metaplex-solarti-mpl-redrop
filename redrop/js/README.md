# mpl-redrop

This package contains the redrop contract SDK code. Derived and adapted from Metaplex foundation redrop

## Developing

In order to update the generated SDK when the rust contract was updated please run:

```
yarn gen:api
```

NOTE: at this point this only generates the IDL json file but later will generate TypeScript
definitions and SDK code as well, derived from that IDL.
